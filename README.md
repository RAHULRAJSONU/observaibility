# **Observability Enhancement Framework**

The **Observability Enhancement Framework** integrates machine learning capabilities into observability systems to enable intelligent analysis of logs and metrics. It leverages advanced preprocessing, training pipelines, and predictive analytics to enhance operational insights, detect anomalies, and forecast system behaviors. This framework is modular, scalable, and designed to be extensible for future enhancements.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Collection and Storage**: Centralized ingestion and storage of logs and metrics using Spring Boot Actuator and custom repositories.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Modular preprocessing strategies to transform raw data into machine-learning-ready feature vectors.
- **Model Training and Management**: Abstracted training workflows using DeepLearning4J for logs and metrics.
- **Prediction Capabilities**: Real-time prediction with confidence scores and evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- **Dashboard Integration**: REST APIs and a ReactJS-based dashboard for visualizing predictions, metrics, and insights.
- **Scalability and Extensibility**: Built with Spring Boot and modular components to support additional data sources and use cases.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Java 23+
- PostgreSQL 17
- Gradle

### **Backend Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd observaibility

2. Configure the database in `application.yml`:
   ```yaml
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/observability
       username: your_username
       password: your_password
   ```

3. Build and run the backend:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the ReactJS application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Endpoints Overview**
| Endpoint                          | Method | Description                           |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| `/api/logs/predictions`           | GET    | Fetch predictions for log data.       |
| `/api/metrics/predictions`        | GET    | Fetch predictions for metric data.    |
| `/api/dashboard/model-metrics`    | GET    | Retrieve model evaluation metrics.    |
| `/api/dashboard/training-summary` | GET    | Get summary of training data.         |

### **Frontend**
Access the dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` after starting the frontend application.

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Ingestion**: Logs and metrics are collected through Spring Boot Actuator and stored in the database.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is transformed into numerical feature vectors for training using modular preprocessors.
3. **Model Training**: Machine learning models are trained using DeepLearning4J, and metrics like accuracy and loss are computed.
4. **Prediction**: Trained models are used for real-time inference, providing predictions and confidence scores.
5. **Visualization**: A ReactJS-based dashboard visualizes predictions, training summaries, and model metrics.

## **Future Enhancements**
- AutoML for model optimization.
- Support for additional data formats (JSON, CSV).
- Integration with external observability tools like Prometheus and ELK Stack.
- Expand predictive capabilities for time-series forecasting.
